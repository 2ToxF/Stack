# Toxic's Stack

## Description
I guess all of you know what stack is. And that's my variation that I'm going to use in my future projects.

## Installation
Just download files from include/ and source/ (you do not need my "main.cpp") and include "stack.h" to your project.

## Usage
All functions return value of "CodeError" data type.

```c
List of the most important functions:

    StackInit(stack_t* stk)                     //  initialazes the stack (not creating!!!)
    StackDtor(stack_t* stk)                     //  destructs the stack
    StackPush(stack_t* stk, StackElem_t value)  //  puts value to stack
    StackPop(stack_t* stk, StackElem_t* var)    //  pulls value from stack
```
